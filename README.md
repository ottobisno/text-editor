Any notes taken will persist between online sessions and the application can even be downloaded and used locally without an internet connection.

**Note:** The application may take a few moments to full load the IndexedDB database. It may be necessary to perform a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R) on the application after waiting a few moments to have the header display properly.
